Mastering Zero Hour's economy is the foundation of all successful strategies. Whether you're facing AI opponents or human players, superior resource management and optimized build orders give you the advantage needed to execute any strategic plan.

## Economic Fundamentals

### Resource System Overview
Zero Hour uses a supply-based economy where workers collect from Supply Piles and deliver to Supply Centers:

#### **Supply Mechanics**
- **Supply Piles**: Finite resources scattered across the map
- **Supply Collection**: Workers automatically collect and deliver supplies
- **Supply Centers**: Buildings that receive and store collected supplies
- **Supply Trucks**: Mobile supply collection for distant resources

#### **Economic Efficiency Factors**
- **Collection Rate**: How fast workers gather supplies
- **Delivery Distance**: Shorter distances = faster collection cycles
- **Worker Count**: More workers = faster collection (with diminishing returns)
- **Supply Center Capacity**: Storage limits can bottleneck collection

### Universal Economic Principles

#### **Early Game Priorities**
1. **Worker Production**: Build workers immediately and continuously
2. **Supply Center Expansion**: Add capacity before hitting storage limits
3. **Resource Expansion**: Secure nearby supply piles quickly
4. **Economic Protection**: Defend workers and infrastructure

#### **Mid Game Development**
1. **Map Control**: Expand to distant supply sources
2. **Economic Diversification**: Multiple supply collection points
3. **Infrastructure Protection**: Defend against raids and harassment
4. **Production Scaling**: Build multiple production facilities

#### **Late Game Management**
1. **Resource Depletion**: Plan for exhausted supply piles
2. **Economic Warfare**: Deny resources to opponents
3. **Strategic Resources**: Control oil derricks and special resources
4. **Sustainable Income**: Maintain economy through extended conflicts

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üí∞ Economic Rule of Thumb</div>
  Aim for one worker per $500 income as a baseline. If you're earning $2000 per minute, you should have approximately 4 workers collecting supplies.

## Advanced Economic Strategies

### Resource Expansion Timing

#### **Early Expansion (5-8 minutes)**
- **Low Risk**: Expand to nearby, easily defended supply piles
- **High Reward**: Increased income for mid-game development
- **Protection Required**: Light defensive coverage
- **All Factions**: Standard practice for competitive play

#### **Mid Expansion (8-15 minutes)**
- **Medium Risk**: Expand to contested or distant supply sources
- **Medium Reward**: Maintain income as nearby sources deplete
- **Protection Required**: Moderate defensive investment
- **Map Control**: Requires some territorial control

#### **Late Expansion (15+ minutes)**
- **High Risk**: Expand to enemy-controlled or dangerous areas
- **Variable Reward**: May be necessary for sustained income
- **Heavy Protection**: Significant defensive investment required
- **Strategic Value**: Often about resource denial rather than gain

### Economic Protection Strategies

#### **Defensive Infrastructure**
- **Static Defenses**: Patriots, Gattling Cannons, Stinger Sites around economic zones
- **Early Warning**: Radar coverage to detect incoming raids
- **Response Forces**: Mobile units positioned for rapid economic defense
- **Redundancy**: Multiple supply collection points to survive attacks

#### **Economic Harassment Counter-Measures**
- **Worker Replacement**: Always have spare workers ready
- **Supply Center Backup**: Build extra capacity to handle temporary disruption
- **Mobile Economy**: Use Supply Trucks for distant and vulnerable collection
- **Rapid Repair**: Dozers/Workers ready to repair damaged infrastructure

### Economic Warfare Tactics

#### **Resource Denial**
- **Supply Pile Control**: Capture supply sources before enemies can use them
- **Economic Raids**: Target enemy workers and supply infrastructure
- **Territorial Control**: Use military presence to deny resource access
- **Strategic Destruction**: Destroy rather than capture resources in some situations

#### **Economic Advantage Conversion**
- **Production Superiority**: Use economic advantage for faster unit production
- **Technology Investment**: Better economy supports expensive technology
- **Strategic Flexibility**: Economic strength allows multiple strategic options
- **Sustained Operations**: Superior economy wins long-term conflicts

## Competitive Build Order Optimization

### Speed Optimization Techniques

#### **Queue Management**
- **Continuous Production**: Never let production facilities sit idle
- **Production Queuing**: Queue multiple units to ensure continuous output
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance spending between economy and military
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Find and eliminate production slowdowns

#### **Efficiency Maximization**
- **Worker Efficiency**: Optimal worker count for available resources
- **Building Placement**: Minimize travel distances for workers
- **Technology Timing**: Research upgrades at optimal moments
- **Resource Flow**: Smooth resource collection and spending patterns

### Adaptation Strategies

#### **Economic Flexibility**
- **Multiple Strategies**: Economic foundation supports various tactical approaches
- **Counter-Development**: Adjust economy based on enemy strategy
- **Resource Allocation**: Shift spending based on immediate needs
- **Economic Recovery**: Rebuild economy after major losses

#### **Situational Adjustments**
- **Map-Specific**: Adjust build order based on map resources and layout
- **Opponent-Specific**: Modify economy based on enemy faction and strategy
- **Game Mode**: Different economic priorities for different game types
- **Risk Assessment**: Balance economic growth with defensive needs
