You've mastered the basics, survived your first year (or two), and now you're ready for the TRUE endgame. This is where Stardew Valley transforms from farming sim into a profit-maximizing empire-building strategy game.

## The Ancient Fruit Empire

Ancient Fruit is THE endgame crop. Here's why and how to build your empire:

### Why Ancient Fruit?

**The Numbers:**
- **Growth:** 28 days initial, then harvest every 7 days
- **Raw sell price:** 550g per fruit
- **Wine sell price:** 1,650g per bottle (3x multiplier!)
- **Iridium wine:** 2,310g (with Artisan profession)
- **Seasons:** Grows Spring, Summer, Fall (dies in Winter)
- **Greenhouse:** Grows YEAR-ROUND indoors

**Yearly profit per plant (greenhouse):**
- 52 weeks √∑ 7 days = ~7 harvests per month
- 12 months √ó 7 harvests = ~84 harvests per year
- 84 √ó 2,310g (iridium wine) = **194,040g per plant per year!**
- 116 greenhouse spaces √ó 194,040g = **22.5 MILLION per year from greenhouse alone!**

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí∞ The Path to Millions</div>
  <strong>Ancient Fruit Wine Formula:</strong> Greenhouse full of Ancient Fruit (116 plants) + 116 kegs + patience = 2 million gold per month passive income. This is how you buy EVERYTHING in the game.
</div>

### How to Get Ancient Fruit Seeds

**Method 1: Museum Donation (Easiest)**
- Donate an Ancient Seed artifact to Gunther
- Receive 1 Ancient Seed to plant + crafting recipe
- This is your first seed

**Method 2: Seed Maker**
- Plant your first ancient fruit
- Put harvested fruit into Seed Maker
- Produces 1-3 ancient seeds (average 2)
- Exponentially grow your seed stock

**Method 3: Traveling Cart (Expensive)**
- Rarely sells ancient seeds for 1000-2000g
- Inconsistent but available

**Growth Strategy:**
- **Year 1 Fall:** Get first ancient seed, plant in greenhouse
- **Year 2 Spring:** Harvest first fruit, make into seeds
- **Year 2 Summer:** Plant 10-20 ancient fruit
- **Year 2 Fall:** Harvest and convert most to seeds
- **Year 2 Winter:** Fill greenhouse completely
- **Year 3+:** Pure profit mode

### Optimal Greenhouse Layout

**116-plant maximum efficiency:**
- 10 √ó 10 center plot = 100 plants
- 16 edge spaces along walls (with sprinklers)
- Total: 116 Ancient Fruit plants
- Use Iridium Sprinklers (6 sprinklers cover everything)
- Optionally: Plant fruit trees on perimeter for bonus income

**Automation:**
- Iridium sprinklers water automatically
- You just harvest every 7 days
- Process all fruit into wine with kegs
- Sell iridium-quality wine for maximum profit

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Keg Requirements</div>
  <strong>You need 116 kegs for full greenhouse efficiency!</strong> That's 3,480 wood, 116 copper bars, 116 iron bars, and 116 oak resin. Start building kegs in Year 1, scale up in Year 2. Place them in sheds or around your farm.
</div>

## Skull Cavern Mastery

The Skull Cavern (Desert) is where the real mining happens. Here's how to survive and thrive:

### Preparation Checklist

**Essential Gear:**
- [ ] Galaxy Sword or better (Lava Katana minimum)
- [ ] Space Boots or better (defense matters!)
- [ ] 50+ bombs (mega bombs preferred)
- [ ] 20+ staircases (craft: 99 stone each)
- [ ] 100+ stone (for emergency staircases)
- [ ] Coffee or Triple Shot Espresso (speed boost)
- [ ] Life Elixir or Gold Star Cheese (healing)
- [ ] Return Scepter (optional, 2M gold from Krobus)

**Check Before Going:**
- **Luck:** Check TV fortune teller - ONLY go on best luck days
- **Buffs:** Eat Lucky Lunch or Spicy Eel (luck + speed)
- **Time:** Start at 6 AM, leave by 1:50 AM maximum
- **Warp Totem Desert:** Craft or buy to get there instantly

### Efficient Skull Cavern Strategy

**The Goal:** Reach floor 100+ for best loot (iridium, prismatic shards)

**Floor 1-50 (Speed Phase):**
1. Use staircases on infested/lava floors (waste of time)
2. Bomb large areas to find holes/ladders quickly
3. Ignore most enemies unless blocking path
4. Eat food for speed boost (coffee essential)
5. Grab iridium nodes as you pass

**Floor 50-100 (Loot Phase):**
1. Continue bombing and staircase use
2. Prioritize iridium nodes (purple/multicolor rocks)
3. Kill dangerous enemies (serpents drop spicy eel)
4. Look for treasure rooms (have good items)
5. Manage health carefully (serpents are deadly)

**Floor 100+ (Endgame Phase):**
1. Every floor has increased iridium spawns
2. Continue until 1 AM (warp home or pass out)
3. Collect 100+ iridium ore per run (good luck day)
4. Prismatic shards more common here

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üíé Prismatic Shard Uses</div>
  <strong>Priority order:</strong><br>
  1st shard: Galaxy Sword (three pillars in desert)<br>
  2nd-4th shards: Enchanting tools<br>
  5th+ shards: Sell (2,000g) or gift (universal love)
</div>

### Skull Cavern Advanced Tips

**Mega Bomb Strategy:**
- Mega bombs destroy large areas instantly
- Reveals ladders and holes quickly
- Much faster than pickaxe mining
- Craft (requires gold + solar essence) or buy from Dwarf

**Hole-Dropping Strategy:**
- Holes drop you 3-15 levels instantly
- Much faster than stairs
- Risky (lose health on landing)
- Use when trying to reach 100+ fast

**Pam's Bus Schedule:**
- Bus leaves at 10 AM from bus stop
- Warp Totem: Desert lets you skip this (start at 6 AM)
- 4 extra hours = 30-50 more floors possible

**Combat Tips:**
- Serpents are your biggest threat (high damage)
- Hit and move - don't stand still
- Use Slime Charmer Ring (no slime damage)
- Iridium Band is best ring (light + damage + magnetic)
