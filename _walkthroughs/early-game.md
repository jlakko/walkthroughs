Congratulations on starting your Minecraft world! The first few days are crucial for survival. This chapter will guide you through the essential early game mechanics that will keep you alive and set you up for long-term success.

## Day 1: Your First Day

### Priority 1: Gather Wood (5 minutes)
Your first priority is wood. Punch trees to collect wood logs, then craft them into planks and sticks.

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üå≥ Wood Gathering Strategy</div>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Collect at least 20 wood logs<br>
  <strong>Method:</strong> Punch the trunk blocks of trees<br>
  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Different wood types are purely cosmetic - any tree works!
</div>

**Essential First Crafts:**
1. **Crafting Table** (4 wood planks)
2. **Wooden Pickaxe** (3 planks + 2 sticks)
3. **Wooden Axe** (3 planks + 2 sticks)
4. **Wooden Sword** (2 planks + 1 stick)

### Priority 2: Find Coal & Stone (10 minutes)
Use your wooden pickaxe to mine stone and look for coal veins.

```
Mining Priority:
1. Stone (for better tools)
2. Coal (for torches and fuel)
3. Iron ore (if you find it)
```

### Priority 3: Basic Shelter (Before Nightfall)
You need protection from monsters that spawn at night.

**Quick Shelter Options:**
- **Dirt Hut:** Fast but temporary
- **Cave:** Natural but potentially dangerous
- **Hill Shelter:** Dig into a hillside

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">üåô Night is Dangerous!</div>
  Monsters spawn in darkness. Always have shelter ready before your first night. You can sleep through the night if you have a bed, or wait it out in your shelter.
</div>

## Day 2-3: Establishing Your Base

### Upgrade Your Tools
Replace wooden tools with stone versions:
- **Stone Pickaxe** (mines faster, lasts longer)
- **Stone Axe** (essential for efficient wood gathering)
- **Stone Sword** (better damage against mobs)

### Food Management
Hunger depletes over time and from activities like mining, jumping, and healing.

**Early Food Sources:**
1. **Animals:** Kill cows, pigs, chickens for meat
2. **Bread:** Craft from wheat (found in villages or grown)
3. **Apples:** Rare drops from oak leaves
4. **Fish:** Craft a fishing rod and fish in water

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üçñ Food Strategy</div>
  <strong>Cook your food!</strong> Raw meat fills less hunger than cooked meat. Use a furnace with coal or wood as fuel.
</div>

### Create Essential Items

**Furnace Recipe:**
- 8 cobblestone arranged in a square (leave center empty)
- Used for cooking food and smelting ores

**Torch Recipe:**
- 1 coal + 1 stick
- Essential for lighting and preventing mob spawns

**Bed Recipe:**
- 3 wood planks + 3 wool (from sheep)
- Allows sleeping through the night and sets your spawn point

## Days 4-7: Expansion & Iron Age

### Iron Mining Strategy
Iron ore is crucial for mid-game progression. It spawns abundantly between Y-levels 0-64.

**Efficient Iron Mining:**
1. Dig down to Y-level 11-12 (press F3 to see coordinates)
2. Create branch mines - long tunnels with side passages
3. Always bring plenty of torches
4. Watch out for lava at lower levels!

  <div class="caption">Efficient branch mining pattern for finding iron ore</div>
</div>

### Essential Iron Tools & Armor
Smelt iron ore in your furnace to create iron ingots, then craft:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Iron Pickaxe** (can mine diamonds and redstone)
2. **Iron Sword** (much better damage)
3. **Full Iron Armor** (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
4. **Iron Axe & Shovel** (efficiency tools)

### Base Improvements

**Security Features:**
- **Fence perimeter** (prevents mob spawning)
- **Lighting** (torches every 7 blocks)
- **Storage room** (chests for organization)
- **Crafting area** (organized workspace)

**Quality of Life:**
- **Item frames** (for organization)
- **Signs** (for labeling)
- **Multiple beds** (backup spawn points)

## Milestones Checklist

Track your early game progress with these essential milestones:

- [ ] Survived first night
- [ ] Created stone tools
- [ ] Built permanent shelter
- [ ] Found and mined iron ore
- [ ] Created full iron armor set
- [ ] Established secure base perimeter
- [ ] Set up efficient food source
- [ ] Collected at least 20 iron ingots
- [ ] Ready for diamond mining

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üìç Navigation Tips</div>
  <strong>Mark your base!</strong> Use landmarks, write down coordinates (F3), or build tall towers to find your way home. Getting lost is a common early game mistake.
</div>

## Common Early Game Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Digging straight down** - You might fall into lava or caves
2. **No food preparation** - Always carry cooked food
3. **Poor lighting** - Dark areas spawn monsters
4. **Overextending exploration** - Stay near your base initially
5. **Not marking your base** - Easy to get lost

## What's Next?

Once you've completed these early game milestones, you're ready for the mid-game phase! You should have:
- A secure, well-lit base
- Full iron armor and tools
- Steady food supply
- At least 20 iron ingots in storage

In the next chapter, we'll focus on finding diamonds, exploring the Nether, and preparing for the final challenge: defeating the Ender Dragon.
