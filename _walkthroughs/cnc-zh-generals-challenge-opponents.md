- **Gattling Tanks**: Mobile anti-air that can keep up with your army
- **Gattling Cannons**: Static defense around key positions
- **Overlord Tanks**: Heavy armor with anti-air upgrades
- **Red Guard**: Cheap infantry that can capture buildings

**Battle Plan:**
1. **Early Game (0-10 min)**: Build economy and basic anti-air defense
2. **Mid Game (10-20 min)**: Mass produce Gattling units and expand
3. **Late Game (20+ min)**: Push with anti-air army to destroy airfields

##### **GLA vs Air Force General**
**Strategy**: Stealth warfare and airfield sabotage

**Build Order:**

##### **USA vs Air Force General**
**Strategy**: Air superiority contest and ground advantage

**Build Order:**
1. Rapid airfield construction
2. Fighter aircraft production
3. Patriot missile defense network
4. Ground army with mobile AA support
5. Counter-air operations

**Key Approach:**
