Welcome to Stardew Valley, farmer! You've just inherited your grandfather's old farm, and it's... well, it's seen better days. But don't worry - with a little elbow grease (and this guide), you'll turn this overgrown mess into a thriving agricultural paradise.

## Your First Day

You wake up in your new farmhouse with 500g to your name and a bunch of parsnip seeds. It's not much, but it's a start!

### Priority 1: Clear Some Land (Morning)

**What to do:**
1. Use your **scythe** (right-click or use tool button) to clear grass and weeds
2. Use your **axe** to remove small tree branches and stumps
3. Use your **pickaxe** to break rocks and stones
4. Save the **hoe** for tilling soil later

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí° Energy Management</div>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Every tool use (except the scythe) drains energy. You start with limited energy, so be strategic! If you run out, you'll pass out and wake up with less energy the next day.
</div>

**Goal:** Clear a 3x3 or 5x5 area near your house. This will be your first crop field.

### Priority 2: Plant Your Parsnips (Late Morning)

You start with 15 parsnip seeds. Time to put them in the ground!

**How to plant:**
1. Equip your **hoe** and till the soil (creates brown farmland)
2. Select the **parsnip seeds** from your inventory
3. Click on each tilled soil to plant a seed
4. Equip your **watering can** and water each planted seed

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Watering is Essential</div>
  Crops need water EVERY day (except when it rains). Forget to water, and they won't grow that day. Check the TV weather forecast each morning!
</div>

### Priority 3: Explore the Town (Afternoon)

With your crops planted, it's time to meet your neighbors!

**Key locations to find:**
- **Pierre's General Store** (north of your farm) - Buy seeds here
- **Community Center** (north of town) - Important later, but check it out
- **Beach** (south exit) - Fishing and foraging
- **Town Square** (center) - Meet villagers and find the calendar

**People to meet on Day 1:**
- **Mayor Lewis** (will probably greet you)
- **Robin** (carpenter, lives north in the mountains)
- **Pierre** (runs the general store)
- **Anyone else you run into** - say hi!

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üí¨ Social Tips</div>
  Every conversation increases your friendship slightly. Early game, just talk to everyone you see. You'll have plenty of time to optimize gift-giving later!
</div>

## Days 2-7: Establishing Your Routine

### Your Daily Schedule

Here's a sustainable early-game routine that won't burn you out:

**Morning (6 AM - 12 PM):**
1. Check TV for weather forecast and cooking show
2. Water your crops (takes about 15-30 minutes in-game)
3. Clear more land OR forage around your farm
4. Pet your cat/dog (when you get one)

**Afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM):**
- **Option A:** Explore the mines (east of town, unlocks Day 5)
- **Option B:** Go fishing (relaxing and profitable)
- **Option C:** Continue clearing land for expansion
- **Option D:** Explore town and meet more villagers

**Evening (6 PM - 12 AM):**
- Talk to villagers (shops close at 5 PM though!)
- Organize your inventory and chests
- Head home by midnight to avoid energy penalties

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Midnight Mechanics</div>
  Stay up past 2 AM and you'll pass out, losing energy and potentially money. Try to be in bed by midnight, especially early game.
</div>

### Essential Skills to Develop

**Foraging (Free Money!):**
- Pick up items you find on the ground - wild horseradish, daffodils, leeks
- Shake berry bushes during Salmonberry (Spring 15-18) and Blackberry (Fall 8-11) seasons
- Chop trees for wood (you'll need lots)
- These items can be sold or gifted

**Fishing (Consistent Income):**
- Available immediately at any water source
- Takes practice, but becomes profitable quickly
- Great way to spend rainy days
- Provides food and trash for crafting

**Mining (Resources & Combat):**
- Unlocks on Day 5 after meeting Joja Corp letter event
- Go as deep as you can, but don't die (you lose items and money)
- Collect ores, gems, and geodes
- Upgrade your tools with copper and iron

### First Week Goals

Here's what you should accomplish by the end of Spring Week 1:

- [ ] Plant and water your initial 15 parsnip seeds
- [ ] Meet at least 10 villagers
- [ ] Locate Pierre's Store, Robin's house, and the Community Center
- [ ] Clear enough land for 50+ crop tiles
- [ ] Try fishing at least once
- [ ] Collect and sell foraged items (aim for 1000g total)
- [ ] Check the calendar for upcoming birthdays/festivals
- [ ] Explore the beach and mountain areas

## Money Management - Your First 2000g

You started with 500g. Here's how to turn that into a thriving operation:

**Week 1 Spending Priority:**
1. **More parsnip seeds** (35g each) - Buy 20-30 more for days 2-3
2. **Cauliflower seeds** (80g each) - Higher profit margin, buy 10-15
3. **Save 400g for strawberry seeds at Egg Festival (Spring 13)**
4. **DON'T buy animals yet** - too expensive early on

**Week 1 Income Sources:**
- Foraging: 200-400g
- Fishing: 200-500g
- Parsnip harvest: 525-700g (15 seeds √ó 35-50g each)
- Spring Onions: Free food from south of town

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí∞ Money-Making Secret</div>
  <strong>Spring Onions near the sewer entrance are FREE FOOD!</strong> Pick them daily and save money on energy restoration. Found just south of Leah's house near the entrance to the sewer area.
</div>

## The Community Center vs. Joja Route

On Day 5 (or when you first enter town after Day 4), you'll trigger a cutscene with the Community Center. This is a huge decision!

### Community Center Path (Recommended for First Playthrough)
- **Pros:** 
  - Unlocks special rewards and cutscenes
  - More engaging long-term goals
  - Feels more rewarding
  - Better story integration
- **Cons:**
  - Requires finding specific items
  - Takes longer to complete
  - More challenging

### Joja Corporation Path
- **Pros:**
  - Simpler - just pay money
  - Faster completion
  - No hunting for rare items
- **Cons:**
  - Expensive (needs 140,000g total)
  - Less satisfying for many players
  - "Bad ending" vibes

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üéØ Our Recommendation</div>
  <strong>Go Community Center route first!</strong> It's more fun, gives you clear goals, and you can always do Joja in a different save file. Plus, this guide assumes Community Center completion.

## Essential First Week Tips

### Things NOT to Worry About Yet
- ‚ùå Building relationships (beyond talking to people)
- ‚ùå Getting married
- ‚ùå Buying animals
- ‚ùå Upgrading your house
- ‚ùå Perfect min-maxing
- ‚ùå Completing the Community Center

### Things to Focus On
- ‚úÖ Learning game mechanics
- ‚úÖ Establishing a daily routine
- ‚úÖ Planting and watering crops
- ‚úÖ Saving money for more seeds
- ‚úÖ Exploring the map
- ‚úÖ Meeting villagers casually
- ‚úÖ Having fun and not stressing!

## Common Beginner Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Watering with an Empty Can**
The watering can holds finite water. Refill it at any water source (pond, river, ocean).

**Mistake #2: Planting Too Many Crops**
Start small! 15-20 crops is plenty when you're learning. You can always expand.

**Mistake #3: Ignoring Energy**
Passing out is expensive. Buy/grow/forage food. Salmonberries (Spring 15-18) are a lifesaver.

**Mistake #4: Not Checking the Calendar**
Birthdays and festivals are on the calendar outside Pierre's store. Missing festivals means missing opportunities!

**Mistake #5: Selling Everything**
Keep at least one of every item you find. Many are needed for Community Center bundles or requests.

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Storage Tip</div>
  Build chests early! Recipe unlocks at Foraging Level 1. You need 50 wood (chop trees). Store items by category - one chest for crops, one for forage, one for mining, etc.
</div>

## Preparing for Spring 13: The Egg Festival

Your first festival is coming! Here's what you need to know:

**What:** Annual egg hunt competition and strawberry seed sale
**When:** Spring 13, 9 AM - 2 PM
**Where:** Town Square (automatic teleport at 9 AM if you leave house)

**What to do:**
1. **Save 400-800g** - Strawberry seeds are 100g each and VERY profitable
2. Buy as many strawberry seeds as you can afford
3. Participate in the egg hunt (try to win for a prize)
4. Talk to villagers for friendship points

**Why strawberries?**
- Sell for 120g minimum (20g profit per harvest)
- Re-grow every 4 days (multiple harvests per season)
- Best Spring crop for profit
- Buy at festival, plant on Spring 13, harvest multiple times before Summer 1
