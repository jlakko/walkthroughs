Now that you've survived your first week, it's time to think strategically about your farm layout and crop planning. This is where good farmers become *great* farmers.

## Farm Layout Fundamentals

### The Golden Rule: Sprinkler-Friendly Design

Hand-watering is for amateurs. Your long-term goal is full automation with sprinklers. Here's the hierarchy:

**Sprinkler Types:**
1. **Basic Sprinkler** - 4 tiles (not worth it, skip)
2. **Quality Sprinkler** - 8 tiles in a square (your best friend) 
3. **Iridium Sprinkler** - 24 tiles (late game luxury)

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üíß Quality Sprinkler Layout</div>
  <strong>Most efficient pattern:</strong> Place quality sprinklers in a grid with 1 empty space between them. This creates 8-crop blocks that are perfectly watered. Aim to build 10-20 quality sprinklers by Summer Year 1.
</div>

### Starting Layout (Spring-Summer Year 1)

**Zone 1: Crop Fields (South of farmhouse)**
- Clear a large rectangular area (20x30 tiles minimum)
- Design in 3x3 grid blocks for future quality sprinklers
- Keep paths between fields for easy navigation
- Start with 40-60 crop tiles, expand to 100+ by Summer

**Zone 2: Animal Area (West side)**
- Reserve space for barn and coop (don't build yet)
- Include grazing area with grass
- Plan for 4-8 tiles per animal building
- Keep some trees for hardwood/shade

**Zone 3: Production/Processing (Near farmhouse)**
- Place chests for organization
- Add crafting stations (furnaces, kegs, preserve jars)
- Keep close to house for efficiency
- Expand this area as you craft more machines

**Zone 4: Tree Farm (Corners/edges)**
- Plant fruit trees in greenhouse or corners
- Maintain regular trees for wood
- Clear center areas for crops first

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Common Layout Mistake</div>
  Don't build everything in the middle! You'll need that premium space for crops later. Push support buildings (coops, barns, sheds) to the edges of your farm.
</div>

## Crop Planning by Season

### Spring Crop Strategy

**Best Money Makers (Spring):**
1. **Strawberries** - 100g seeds (Festival only), harvest every 4 days
2. **Cauliflower** - 80g seeds, 175g+ sell, 12-day growth
3. **Potatoes** - 50g seeds, 80g+ sell, 6-day growth, chance for extra potatoes
4. **Parsnips** - 20g seeds, 35g+ sell, 4-day growth (early game filler)

**Spring Planting Calendar:**
- **Day 1-12:** Mixed crops (cauliflower, potatoes, parsnips)
- **Day 13+:** STRAWBERRIES! Plant everything you bought
- **Day 25+:** Don't plant anything that won't finish before Summer 1

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üå± Pro Spring Strategy</div>
  <strong>Optimal Spring Plan:</strong> Invest 1000-2000g in strawberry seeds at Egg Festival. Plant immediately. With 4-day growth, you'll get 4 harvests (Spring 17, 21, 25, 29) = 80g profit per seed. That's 3200-6400g profit!
</div>

### Summer Crop Strategy

Summer is where your farm explodes in profitability!

**Best Money Makers (Summer):**
1. **Blueberries** - 80g seeds, harvest every 4 days, multiple berries per harvest
2. **Melons** - 80g seeds, 250g+ sell, 12-day growth
3. **Starfruit** - 400g seeds, 800g+ sell (Desert vendor only, mid-game)
4. **Hops** - 60g seeds, harvest daily (needs trellis)

**Summer Money Strategy:**
- Plant 60-80% blueberries (consistent income)
- Plant 20-30% melons (quality crop chance)
- Save energy with sprinklers (should have 10+ by now)

**Summer Planting Calendar:**
- **Day 1:** Plant EVERYTHING - full farm
- **Day 10-15:** Start thinking about Fall crop prep
- **Day 24+:** Let current crops finish, don't plant new ones

### Fall Crop Strategy

Fall is premium profit time. No excuses - fill your entire farm.

**Best Money Makers (Fall):**
1. **Cranberries** - 240g seeds, harvest every 5 days, multiple berries
2. **Pumpkins** - 100g seeds, 320g+ sell, 13-day growth
3. **Rare Seeds** (Sweet Gem Berry) - 1000g, 3000g+ sell, 24-day growth
4. **Grapes** - 60g seeds, harvest every 3 days (needs trellis)

**Fall Money Strategy:**
- Cranberries are KING - plant 70-80% of farm
- Pumpkins for quality crops and giant crop chance
- Buy 1-5 Rare Seeds from Traveling Cart if you can afford

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí∞ Fall Profit Explosion</div>
  <strong>Expected earnings:</strong> With 150 cranberry plants and basic farming level, expect 60,000g+ profit for the season. This is where you transition from struggling farmer to agricultural tycoon.
</div>

## Quality Crops & Fertilizer

### Understanding Crop Quality

Crops come in three qualities (four with special fertilizer):
- **Regular** - Base sell price
- **Silver** - 1.25√ó base price
- **Gold** - 1.5√ó base price
- **Iridium** - 2√ó base price (requires Deluxe Fertilizer)

**What affects quality:**
- Your Farming skill level (higher = better quality chance)
- Fertilizer used
- Random luck factor

### Fertilizer Guide

**Basic Fertilizer** - Crafting Level 0 (2 sap)
- Improves quality chance
- Good for early game

**Quality Fertilizer** - Farming Level 9 (2 sap, 1 fish)
- Much better quality chance
- Use on high-value crops (melons, pumpkins, starfruit)

**Deluxe Speed-Gro** - Farming Level 8
- 25% faster growth
- Great for maximizing harvests per season

**Deluxe Fertilizer** - Late game
- Guarantees higher quality tiers
- Expensive, save for ancient fruit

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö° Fertilizer Strategy</div>
  <strong>Best practice:</strong> Use Speed-Gro on crops with multiple harvests (blueberries, cranberries). Use Quality Fertilizer on single-harvest high-value crops (melons, pumpkins). Basic crops (parsnips) don't need fertilizer.
</div>

## Tool Upgrades Priority

Your starting tools are garbage. Here's the upgrade path:

### Upgrade Order (By Priority):
1. **Watering Can ‚Üí Copper** (FIRST UPGRADE) - 5 tiles watered
2. **Pickaxe ‚Üí Copper** - Break large rocks, needed for mine progression
3. **Axe ‚Üí Copper** - Large stumps for hardwood
4. **Watering Can ‚Üí Steel** - 9 tiles watered
5. **Pickaxe ‚Üí Steel** - Mine progression

**Don't upgrade hoe until you have sprinklers - you won't need it much!**

### Upgrade Logistics:

**Cost per upgrade:**
- Copper: 2000g + 5 copper bars
- Steel: 5000g + 5 iron bars  
- Gold: 10,000g + 5 gold bars
- Iridium: 25,000g + 5 iridium bars

**Pro tip:** Upgrade watering can on Day 27-28 of any season. You won't need it for the last few days, and it'll be ready for Day 1 of next season!

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Upgrade Timing</div>
  Clint takes 2 days to upgrade tools and you CAN'T use them during that time. Plan accordingly! Never upgrade during harvest periods.
</div>

## Sprinkler Crafting & Placement

### Quality Sprinkler Recipe (Unlock: Farming Level 6)
- 1 Iron Bar
- 1 Gold Bar  
- 1 Refined Quartz

**Goal:** Have 20-30 quality sprinklers by Summer Year 1

### Mining for Sprinkler Materials:

**Iron Ore (Floors 40-80 in mines):**
- Need 60+ iron ore for 15 sprinklers
- Prioritize mining Days 10-20 of Spring

**Gold Ore (Floors 80-120 in mines):**
- Need 15+ gold ore  
- Focus on mines Days 25+ of Spring or early Summer

**Refined Quartz (Smelt quartz in furnace):**
- Quartz from mines or beach rocks
- Need 15+ refined quartz

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">‚õèÔ∏è Mining Marathon</div>
  <strong>Sprint Strategy:</strong> Dedicate 5-7 consecutive days to mining in late Spring. Goal: Reach floor 80-100 and collect 60 iron + 20 gold ore. Use bombs for efficiency. This investment pays off all year!
</div>

## Efficient Farming Routines

### Morning Routine (30 minutes):
1. Check TV weather + cooking show
2. Water crops (or skip if sprinklered!)
3. Harvest ready crops
4. Pet animals + collect products
5. Replant any empty spots

### Core Day Activities:
- **Rainy Days:** Fish or mine (save energy from watering)
- **Non-Rainy:** Mine or socialize
- **Harvest Days:** Process crops ‚Üí sell ‚Üí buy more seeds

### Evening Routine (10 minutes):
1. Ship crops/items
2. Organize chests
3. Craft needed items
4. Plan tomorrow's activities
5. Bed by midnight

</div>

## Profit Optimization Strategies

### The Preserve Jar Method (Early Game)

**Recipe:** 50 wood, 40 stone, 8 coal
**Function:** Turns crops into pickles/jam (2-3x value)
**Process Time:** 2-4 days depending on crop

**Best crops to preserve:**
- Blueberries ‚Üí Blueberry Jam (150g)
- Cranberries ‚Üí Cranberry Jam (175g)
- Cauliflower ‚Üí Pickles (400g)
- Melons ‚Üí Pickles (550g)

**Strategy:** Build 10 preserve jars by Summer, 20+ by Fall

### The Keg Method (Mid-Late Game)

**Recipe:** 30 wood, 1 copper bar, 1 iron bar, 1 oak resin
**Function:** Turns crops into wine/juice (3x value)
**Process Time:** 7 days (worth the wait!)

**Best crops for kegs:**
- Starfruit ‚Üí Starfruit Wine (2,250g!)
- Ancient Fruit ‚Üí Ancient Fruit Wine (1,650g)
- Melons ‚Üí Melon Juice (275g)

**Strategy:** Kegs are expensive early on. Start with 5 kegs, scale to 50+ in Year 2.

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üíé Profit Comparison</div>
  <strong>Raw vs. Processed:</strong><br>
  Raw Starfruit: 800g<br>
  Starfruit Jam: 1,550g (preserve jar)<br>
  Starfruit Wine: 2,250g (keg)<br>
  <strong>Kegs are 2.8x more profitable but take longer!</strong>

## Common Farm Setup Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Not Planning for Sprinklers**
Build your fields in sprinkler-compatible patterns from Day 1. Hand-watering 200 crops isn't sustainable.

**Mistake #2: Too Many Buildings Too Soon**
Every barn/coop costs 10,000g+ and requires daily upkeep. Focus on crops first, animals later.

**Mistake #3: Not Using Preserve Jars**
Selling raw crops is leaving money on the table. Even 5 preserve jars doubles your profit.

**Mistake #4: Poor Chest Organization**
"I'll remember where I put that..." No, you won't. Label areas and group similar items.

**Mistake #5: Random Planting**
Plant in blocks by crop type. Makes harvesting and calculation easier. Chaos farming is inefficient farming.

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è The 3x3 Rule</div>
  Certain crops (cauliflower, melon, pumpkin) can become "giant crops" when planted in 3x3 patterns. Giant crops give more harvest and look cool. Always plant these in 3x3 blocks!
</div>

## Year 1 Farm Goals Checklist

By the end of Year 1, aim to have:

- [ ] 150-200 crop tiles with quality sprinklers
- [ ] 15-20 preserve jars operating
- [ ] 5+ kegs if you can manage
- [ ] Steel or gold watering can (for any hand-watering)
- [ ] At least 1 barn OR 1 coop (not both yet)
- [ ] Greenhouse unlocked (from Community Center)
- [ ] 30,000g+ saved for Year 2 expansion
- [ ] Farming skill level 8+
