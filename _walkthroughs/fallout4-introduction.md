## Difficulty and Game Mode Considerations

Your choice of difficulty and survival settings significantly impacts the experience:

### üìà Difficulty Scaling
- **Very Easy/Easy**: Story focus, minimal combat challenge
- **Normal**: Balanced experience for most players
- **Hard**: Increased challenge requiring better tactics
- **Very Hard**: Significant bullet-sponge enemies, resource scarcity
- **Survival**: Complete game overhaul (see below)

### üèÉ Survival Mode Changes
Survival mode isn't just harder - it's a different game:
- **No fast travel** (except via Vertibird later)
- **Save only when sleeping** in beds
- **Hunger, thirst, and fatigue** affect performance
- **Disease and radiation** have serious consequences
- **Carry weight severely limited**
- **Increased damage** both given and received

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö° Survival Mode Recommendation</div>
  Consider Survival mode only if you:
  <ul>
    <li>Have completed the game at least once</li>
    <li>Enjoy challenging resource management</li>
    <li>Don't mind losing progress from unsaved deaths</li>
    <li>Want maximum immersion and settlement utility</li>
  </ul>
