Welcome to the beautiful and challenging world of Hollow Knight! This Metroidvania masterpiece can be overwhelming at first, but with the right foundation, you'll be exploring Hallownest like a pro.

## What Makes Hollow Knight Special

Hollow Knight combines tight platforming controls with deep exploration, meaningful progression, and some of the most satisfying combat in the genre. Unlike many Metroidvania games, it doesn't hold your hand - discovery and experimentation are core to the experience.

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üéÆ Philosophy</div>
  Hollow Knight rewards curiosity, persistence, and skill development. Every death is a learning opportunity, and every new area offers mysteries to uncover.
</div>

## Essential Controls & Movement

### Basic Movement
- **Left/Right**: Move left and right
- **Jump**: Your primary mobility tool
- **Down + Jump**: Drop through one-way platforms
- **Hold Down**: Look down to see below you

### Combat Basics
- **Attack**: Your nail (sword) - can be used in all directions
- **Up + Attack**: Upward slash
- **Down + Attack (while airborne)**: Downward slash (pogo jumping)
- **Focus** (Hold): Heal yourself using Soul

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö° Master This Early</div>
  <strong>Pogo Jumping:</strong> Attacking downward while jumping allows you to bounce off enemies and spikes. This isn't just combat - it's essential movement for many areas!
</div>

### Advanced Movement (You'll Learn These)
- **Wall Jump**: Unlocked later, allows wall climbing
- **Dash**: Quick horizontal movement with invincibility frames
- **Double Jump**: Extended air mobility
- **Super Dash**: High-speed horizontal movement

## Understanding the Core Systems

### Health & Soul
- **Masks**: Your health points (start with 5)
- **Soul**: Energy gained by hitting enemies, used for healing and spells
- **Healing**: Uses 1 Soul gauge, restores 1 Mask
- **Soul Meter**: Shows your current Soul (max starts at 99)

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí° Healing Strategy</div>
  Find safe spots to heal during fights. Healing takes time and leaves you vulnerable, so timing is crucial!
</div>

### Currency & Progression
- **Geo**: The currency of Hallownest, dropped by enemies and found in the world
- **Charms**: Equippable items that modify your abilities
- **Charm Notches**: Limit how many charms you can equip
- **Mask Shards**: Collect 4 to gain an extra health mask
- **Vessel Fragments**: Collect 3 to increase your Soul capacity

### Exploration Tools
- **Maps**: Purchase area maps from Cornifer, then fill in details by exploring
- **Quill**: Allows you to mark points of interest on your map
- **Pins**: Various markers you can place for waypoints, shops, etc.

## Your First Hour: Immediate Goals

### 1. Learn the Movement
The tutorial area (King's Pass) teaches basic movement, but don't rush through it. Practice:
- **Precise jumping**: The game rewards accuracy
- **Combat timing**: Learn when to attack vs. when to dodge
- **Pogo bouncing**: Try downward attacks on enemies

### 2. Get Your Bearings in Dirtmouth
- **Talk to everyone**: NPCs provide valuable hints and context
- **Visit shops**: See what's available (you probably can't afford much yet)
- **Check the map shop**: Iselda sells maps and mapping tools

### 3. Explore the Forgotten Crossroads
This is your first real area. Focus on:
- **Buy the area map**: From Cornifer (he's humming, so listen for him!)
- **Find a bench**: These are your save points and fast travel locations
- **Collect Geo**: You'll need currency for essential purchases

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Tips</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Always buy the map first when entering a new area</li>
    <li>Place pins at locked doors to remember where to return</li>
    <li>Mark shops and NPCs you want to revisit</li>
    <li>Dead ends often hide secrets - check walls thoroughly</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Combat Fundamentals

### Basic Enemy Encounters
- **Study patterns**: Most enemies have predictable attack patterns
- **Use your range**: Your nail has good reach - use it
- **Space properly**: Learn the right distance for safe attacks
- **Stay mobile**: Standing still usually means taking damage

### Building Soul for Healing
- **Hit enemies consistently**: Every successful hit builds Soul
- **Don't waste Soul**: Only heal when you really need it
- **Save Soul for tough fights**: You'll want full Soul for boss encounters

### Early Combat Tips
- **Patience over aggression**: Rushing leads to unnecessary damage
- **Learn to pogo**: Bouncing off enemies is often safer than ground combat
- **Use the environment**: Some enemies are easier to approach from certain angles

## Essential Early Purchases

### Priority #1: Wayward Compass (220 Geo)
- Shows your location on the map
- Absolutely essential for navigation
- Buy this as soon as you can afford it

### Priority #2: Gathering Swarm (300 Geo)
- Auto-collects Geo drops
- Massive quality of life improvement
- Helps ensure you don't lose currency

### Priority #3: First Charm Notch Upgrade (120 Geo)
- Allows equipping more charms
- Found at Salubra's shop in Forgotten Crossroads
- Increases your customization options

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üí∞ Geo Management</div>
  <strong>Important:</strong> You drop all your Geo when you die! Return to your "shade" to collect it, but if you die again before collecting, it's lost forever. Spend Geo regularly on useful upgrades.
</div>

## Understanding Death & Consequences

### What Happens When You Die
1. You lose all your Geo at the death location
2. Your Soul meter is cracked (reduced max capacity)
3. You respawn at your last bench
4. A "shade" appears at your death location

### Recovering from Death
- **Find your shade**: It appears where you died
- **Attack it**: This recovers your Geo and repairs your Soul meter
- **Be careful**: If you die again before recovering your shade, the previous Geo is lost

### Death Prevention
- **Know your escape routes**: Always have a plan to retreat
- **Don't get greedy**: Sometimes backing off is the right choice
- **Use benches strategically**: Saving often reduces the cost of death

## Recommended Early Game Path

### 1. Master the Basics (First 30 minutes)
- Complete King's Pass tutorial
- Explore Dirtmouth thoroughly
- Purchase Wayward Compass

### 2. Map Forgotten Crossroads (Next hour)
- Buy the area map from Cornifer
- Find and activate all benches
- Clear easy enemy encounters for Geo

### 3. First Ability Acquisition

- This opens up new areas and movement options
- Practice with the new ability before moving on

### 4. Essential Charm Collection

- Look for your first offensive charm (Fury of the Fallen)
- Start experimenting with charm combinations

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

### Navigation Errors
- **Not buying maps**: You'll get hopelessly lost
- **Ignoring pins**: Mark important locations immediately
- **Rushing through areas**: Slow, methodical exploration reveals secrets

### Combat Mistakes
- **Button mashing**: Precise timing beats frantic attacking

### Progression Mistakes
- **Hoarding Geo**: Spend it on useful upgrades regularly
