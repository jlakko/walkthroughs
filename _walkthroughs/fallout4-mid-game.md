By level 15-30, you're no longer just surviving‚Äîyou're thriving and expanding your influence across the Commonwealth. This chapter covers power armor mastery, settlement network growth, equipment optimization, and strategic map exploration that prepares you for the faction conflicts ahead.

## Power Armor Mastery

### ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding Power Armor Systems
Power armor fundamentally changes how you approach combat and exploration:

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Fusion Core Dependency**: 20-30 minutes of operation per core
- **Damage Absorption**: Reduces incoming damage significantly
- **Strength Bonus**: Carry more, melee harder, access restricted areas
- **Radiation Protection**: Near-immunity to environmental hazards
- **Fall Damage Immunity**: Jump from any height safely

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö° Fusion Core Economy</div>
  <strong>Core Sources:</strong> Generators, robots, military installations, vendors<br>
  <strong>Conservation:</strong> Exit armor when crafting or in safe areas<br>
  <strong>Cost Analysis:</strong> ~200-300 caps per core, 20-30 minutes operation<br>
  <strong>Break-even:</strong> Efficient if you earn 10+ caps per minute in armor
</div>

### üõ°Ô∏è Power Armor Variants and Locations

### üîß Power Armor Modification Strategy

**Upgrade Priority Order:**
1. **Core Assembly**: Fusion core duration improvements
2. **Chest Piece**: Overall damage reduction and special abilities
3. **Helmet**: HUD improvements and environmental protection
4. **Arms**: Melee damage and utility improvements
5. **Legs**: Movement speed and fall damage (already immune)

### ‚ö° Power Armor Combat Tactics

**Advantages in Combat:**
- **Damage Resistance**: 50-80% damage reduction with good armor
- **Intimidation**: Some enemies flee from power armor users
- **Heavy Weapons**: Stability bonuses for large weapons
- **Environmental**: Immunity to radiation and fall damage

**Tactical Considerations:**
- **Fusion Core Targeting**: Enemies can target your power source
- **Mobility**: Slower movement speed, louder footsteps
- **Stealth Penalty**: Power armor prevents effective sneaking
- **Water**: Can walk underwater but limited visibility

## Settlement Network Expansion

### üèóÔ∏è Advanced Settlement Strategy

By mid-game, transform from individual settlements to integrated network:

**Phase 1: Hub Establishment (Levels 15-20)**

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üè≠ Settlement Efficiency Formula</div>
  <strong>Optimal Settlement Size:</strong> 20-24 settlers (bell/siren cap)<br>
  <strong>Resource Ratio:</strong> 1 food + 1 water per settler, defense = total settlement value<br>
  <strong>Happiness Formula:</strong> Basic needs (60) + variety bonus (10) + shops (20) + special items (10)<br>
  <strong>Supply Line Strategy:</strong> Star pattern with central hub reduces NPC count
</div>
