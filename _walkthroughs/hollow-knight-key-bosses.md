Boss fights in Hollow Knight are some of the most memorable and challenging encounters in gaming. Each boss teaches you something new about combat, movement, or the game's systems. This chapter covers essential strategies for the major bosses you'll encounter.

## Boss Fight Philosophy

### Understanding Hollow Knight Combat
Unlike many action games, Hollow Knight rewards:
- **Pattern recognition** over reaction speed
- **Positioning** over aggressive damage dealing
- **Patience** over rushing to finish fights
- **Adaptation** over rigid strategies

### Universal Boss Strategies
1. **Learn before attacking**: Spend the first attempt just observing patterns
2. **Find safe spots**: Every boss has positions where you can't be hit
3. **Heal strategically**: Most bosses have predictable healing windows
4. **Manage Soul**: Balance offensive spells with healing needs

<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üéØ Boss Progression</div>
  Each boss builds on skills from previous fights. If you're struggling, make sure you've mastered earlier bosses and have appropriate upgrades.
</div>

## Early Game Bosses

### False Knight
**Location:** Forgotten Crossroads
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Beginner)
**When to fight:** Early in game, after acquiring basic movement

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Ground Slam**: Telegraphed overhead attack that creates shockwaves
- **Charge Attack**: Runs across the arena with armor extended
- **Falling Debris**: Chunks fall from ceiling during certain attacks

**Strategy:**
1. **Stay mobile**: Keep moving to avoid ground slams
2. **Attack the body**: When armor falls off, hit the small creature inside
3. **Use the walls**: Climb walls to avoid ground-based attacks
4. **Heal during staggers**: When the creature is exposed, you have time to heal

**Recommended charms:** Gathering Swarm (collect Geo), Fury of the Fallen (extra damage when low on health)

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí° False Knight Tips</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The real boss is the small creature, not the armor</li>
    <li>Wall climbing is your best defense against ground attacks</li>
    <li>Don't get greedy - wait for clear openings</li>
    <li>Practice pogo jumping on the creature when it's exposed</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Hornet (Greenpath)
**Location:** Greenpath
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)
**When to fight:** After acquiring dash ability

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Dash Attack**: Quick horizontal movement with needle extended
- **Silk Shot**: Ranged projectile that pins you if it hits
- **Leap Attack**: Jumps toward your position
- **Thread Trap**: Creates silk traps on the ground

**Strategy:**
1. **Dash timing**: Use your dash to avoid her dash attacks
2. **Stay airborne**: Reduces ground trap effectiveness
3. **Punish recovery**: Attack after she misses her dash
4. **Break silk pins**: Jump repeatedly if caught by silk shot

**Key lessons:** This fight teaches dash timing and aerial combat positioning

### Massive Moss Charger
**Location:** Greenpath
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Easy-Intermediate)
**When to fight:** Optional, but good practice

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Charge attacks**: Runs back and forth across the arena
- **Spore clouds**: Releases toxic spores when damaged
- **Wall bouncing**: Bounces off walls unpredictably

**Strategy:**
1. **Use pogo jumping**: Bounce on its back to avoid charges
2. **Stay above spore clouds**: Airborne positioning is key
3. **Time your attacks**: Hit when it's stunned after wall impacts

## Mid Game Bosses

### Mantis Lords
**Location:** Mantis Village (Fungal Wastes)
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)
**When to fight:** After acquiring wall jump ability

**Phase 1 - Single Mantis:**
- **Boomerang throw**: Projectile that returns
- **Dash attack**: Quick horizontal movement
- **Wall jump attacks**: Attacks from wall positions

**Phase 2 - Two Mantis Lords:**
- **Coordinated attacks**: Both lords attack simultaneously
- **Cross patterns**: Attacks that require precise positioning
- **Wall-to-wall coordination**: Complex movement patterns

**Strategy:**
1. **Master Phase 1**: Don't attempt Phase 2 until Phase 1 is comfortable
2. **Use the center**: Stay in the middle to see both lords in Phase 2
3. **Dash timing is crucial**: Their attacks have precise timing windows
4. **Wall jump defensively**: Use walls to escape when overwhelmed

<div class="tip-box warning">
