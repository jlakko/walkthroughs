Welcome to the Commonwealth! Your first week outside Vault 111 sets the foundation for everything that follows. This chapter covers essential survival skills, settlement basics, and the critical early quests that introduce you to the wasteland's major players.

## Your First Hour: Immediate Priorities

### üè† Sanctuary Hills Setup
Your pre-war neighborhood becomes your first settlement. Here's how to make it livable:

**Phase 1: Resource Gathering (First 30 minutes)**
1. **Scrap everything**: Fallen trees, cars, debris, broken houses
2. **Collect Pre-War items**: Dinner plates, coffee cups, cigarettes (everything has value)
3. **Harvest wild resources**: Mutfruit trees, corn, tatos around the settlement
4. **Loot every house**: Weapons, ammo, and crafting materials in old homes

<div class="tip-box">

## The Adhesive Economy: Your Crafting Foundation

Adhesive is the most valuable crafting material in Fallout 4. Master this early:

2. **Build water purifiers** for consistent purified water supply
3. **Cook regularly** at chemistry station to convert vegetables to adhesive
4. **Expand production** as you gain more settlements

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üí∞ Economic Impact</div>

  </div>
  <div class="spoiler-content">
    <p><strong>Pacing tip:</strong> You can delay main quest progression indefinitely after reaching Diamond City. This allows extensive settlement building and exploration without advancing faction conflicts.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Preston Garvey:</strong> Completing too many Minutemen quests early can lead to repetitive settlement requests. Consider doing 2-3 to establish the faction, then delay others until you want to focus on Minutemen path.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Power Armor Strategy:</strong> The Concord power armor is optional. If you prefer to earn power armor later, you can sneak past the Deathclaw or use alternative tactics.</p>

## Settlement Network Strategy

### üîó Supply Line Planning
Connect settlements efficiently to share resources:

**Hub System (Recommended):**

- **Advantage**: Fewer supply line NPCs needed, easier management

**Specialized Settlements:**
- **Food producers**: Large settlements with good soil (Sanctuary, Abernathy Farm)
- **Water factories**: Coastal settlements with purifier capacity (Spectacle Island, Castle)
- **Scrap yards**: Urban settlements for junk production (Hangman's Alley, Jamaica Plain)

### üìä Settlement Happiness Optimization

**Happiness Factors:**
- **Basic needs**: Water, food, beds, defense (60 happiness max)
- **Variety bonus**: Different food types, multiple water sources
- **Recreation**: Bar, clinic, general store provide happiness bonuses
- **Companion bonus**: Some companions provide settlement happiness
