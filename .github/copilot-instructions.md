# üéÆ Walkthrough Writing Guide for Gamers

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for creating comprehensive, engaging, and humorous game walkthroughs that help gamers master their favorite games. Our goal is to make complex gaming concepts accessible, enjoyable, and memorable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Structure & Technical Setup

### Project Overview
This is a Jekyll-based static site hosted on GitHub Pages. The site features:
- **Jekyll Collections** for organizing walkthrough content
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach
- **Theme switching** (Light, Dark, Minecraft, Ocean)
- **Progress tracking** for readers
- **Spoiler system** for story-sensitive content

### Directory Structure
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _walkthroughs/          # Individual chapter markdown files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _layouts/               # Jekyll layout templates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _sass/                  # SCSS stylesheets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                 # JavaScript, images, and other assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [game-name]/           # Game-specific landing pages (e.g., fallout4/, minecraft/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _config.yml            # Jekyll configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ copilot-instructions.md
```

### Working with Jekyll Collections
- All walkthrough chapters go in `_walkthroughs/` directory
- Each game has a landing page in its own directory (e.g., `fallout4/index.md`)
- Collections are configured in `_config.yml` with `output: true`
- Chapters automatically get `/walkthroughs/[filename]/` URLs

### Building and Testing Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run Jekyll development server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Access at http://localhost:4000/walkthroughs/
```

### Key Files to Update When Adding Content
1. **New chapter file**: Add to `_walkthroughs/` with proper front matter
2. **Game landing page**: Create or update `[game-name]/index.md`
3. **Homepage**: Update `index.md` to add new walkthrough card
4. **Navigation**: Update `_layouts/default.html` if adding new game section

### File Naming Conventions
- Chapter files: `[game-name]-[chapter-name].md` (e.g., `fallout4-introduction.md`)
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Keep names descriptive but concise

## üìã Front Matter Requirements

Every chapter file must include complete front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Chapter Title"                      # Required: Display title
description: "Brief chapter description"    # Required: For SEO and navigation
walkthrough: "game-name"                   # Required: Collection identifier (lowercase, hyphenated)
walkthrough_title: "Game Complete Guide"   # Required: Display name for breadcrumbs
chapter_order: 1                           # Required: Numeric order for sorting (integer)
estimated_time: "30 minutes"               # Optional: Reading time estimate
breadcrumbs:                               # Optional: Navigation breadcrumbs
  - title: "Home"
    url: "/"
  - title: "Game Guide"
    url: "/game/"
  - title: "Chapter Title"
tips:                                      # Optional: Quick tips for sidebar
  - "Helpful tip 1"
  - "Helpful tip 2"
tags: [game-name, category]                # Optional: SEO tags
---
```

### Front Matter Best Practices
- **walkthrough**: Must match across all chapters of the same game
- **chapter_order**: Use integers (1, 2, 3...) for proper sorting
- **estimated_time**: Help readers plan their reading sessions
- **breadcrumbs**: Maintain consistent hierarchy across chapters
- **tips**: Include 2-4 actionable tips relevant to the chapter

## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Write for Real Gamers
- **Assume some gaming knowledge** but explain mechanics clearly
- **Use gaming terminology** that feels natural to the community
- **Address common pain points** that every player experiences
- **Include both newbie-friendly and advanced strategies**

### 2. Inject Personality & Humor
- **Be conversational**, not robotic or overly formal
- **Use gaming humor** and references that resonate with players
- **Share relatable gaming experiences** ("We've all been there...")
- **Add personality** without overwhelming the core information
- **Use emojis strategically** to break up text and add visual interest

### 3. Structure for Success
- **Break content into digestible chunks** (5-10 minute sections)
- **Use clear headings** that describe exactly what players will learn
- **Include time estimates** for each major section
- **Provide checklists** so players can track their progress
- **Add navigation aids** between related sections

## üìù Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Tone**: Friendly, knowledgeable, and slightly humorous
- **Voice**: Second person ("you") to directly address the player
- **Length**: Comprehensive but scannable - use bullet points and short paragraphs
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-friendly formatting with plenty of whitespace

### Essential Elements to Include

#### Opening Hook
Start each section with why this matters:
```markdown
## Mining Your First Diamonds
You've probably died in lava more times than you'd like to admit while searching for these blue beauties. Let's change that with some proven strategies that actually work.
```

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
Break complex tasks into numbered steps:
```markdown
**Diamond Mining Strategy:**
1. Dig down to Y-level 11 (press F3 to check coordinates)
2. Create branch mines with 2-block spacing
3. Listen for lava before breaking blocks
4. Always bring a water bucket (trust us on this one)
```

#### Pro Tips & Warnings
Use formatted boxes for crucial information:
```markdown
<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üíé Pro Tip</div>
  Never dig straight down. Seriously. That's how you meet lava face-first.
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
  <div class="warning-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake</div>
  Don't mine diamonds with a stone pickaxe - you'll just destroy them!
</div>
```

#### Progress Milestones
Include checkboxes for tracking progress:
```markdown
## Chapter Milestones
- [ ] Survived your first night without rage-quitting
- [ ] Built a house that doesn't look like a dirt cube
- [ ] Found your first diamond (screenshot it, we won't judge)
- [ ] Defeated the Ender Dragon (legendary status achieved)
```

### üé™ Adding Humor & Personality

#### Gaming References
- Reference common gaming experiences everyone relates to
- Use popular gaming memes and terminology appropriately
- Acknowledge the shared struggles of gaming

#### Relatable Scenarios
```markdown
We've all been that player who spends 3 hours building the perfect house only to realize we forgot to add a door. Or the one who carefully plans a mining expedition but forgets to bring food and starves 5 blocks from home.
```

#### Self-Deprecating Humor
```markdown
After approximately 47 failed attempts at beating this boss (not that anyone's counting), here's what actually works...
```

#### Community Inside Jokes
Reference well-known gaming phenomena that players will immediately recognize:
```markdown
Remember, this isn't Dark Souls - dying here just means you lose your stuff, not your sanity.
```

### üí° Tips & Tricks Integration

#### Timing is Everything
- **Early tips**: Focus on survival and avoiding common mistakes
- **Mid-game tips**: Efficiency improvements and quality of life
