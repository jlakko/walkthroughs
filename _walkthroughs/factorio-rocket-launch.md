  <strong>The factory must grow!</strong> Many players spend hundreds of hours after the first rocket launch, continuously optimizing and expanding. There's always a way to build bigger and better!
</div>

## Common Rocket Launch Problems

### "I can't research Rocket Silo!"
- Need ALL science packs working (red, green, blue, purple, yellow)
- Check if science production is backed up
- Ensure labs are connected and powered

### "Rocket component production is too slow!"
- Scale up! You need massive production
- Add more assemblers (10+ per component type)
- Upgrade to Assembling Machine 3 (fastest)
- Use productivity modules for efficiency

### "I keep running out of resources!"
- Rocket needs HUGE throughput
- Scale ore mining to 8+ full belts
- Add more smelting arrays
- Consider train networks for distant ore patches

### "Processing units are the bottleneck!"
- They're slow to produce - this is normal
- Scale to 20+ assemblers for blue circuits
- Ensure sulfuric acid supply is sufficient
- Consider speed modules (but they're expensive)

### "My power grid can't keep up!"
- Rocket production needs MASSIVE power
- Build more steam engines or solar panels
- Check if fuel supply is consistent
- Monitor power production graph

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö° Power Crisis</div>
  <strong>Late game power demands are extreme!</strong> Plan for 200-500+ MW of power generation. Solar panels become attractive once you can mass-produce them.
</div>

## Final Tips for Success

**Resource Planning:**
- Always build MORE than you think you need
- Double your planned production, then double again
- Bottlenecks will appear - be ready to expand

**Layout Strategy:**
- Keep production organized (main bus helps!)
- Leave room for expansion
- Use blueprints for repeated structures

**Mental Preparation:**
- The rocket takes 40-100+ hours for first-time players
- You'll rebuild sections multiple times (that's normal!)
- Celebrate small victories along the way

**The Factorio Mindset:**
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- Build it now, optimize it later
- The factory must grow!
