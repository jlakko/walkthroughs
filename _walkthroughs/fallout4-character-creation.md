The character you create determines not just your combat effectiveness, but how you'll experience the Commonwealth's moral complexities. This chapter provides four distinct archetypes aligned with Fallout 4's major factions, complete with SPECIAL builds, backstories, and roleplay guidelines.

## Understanding SPECIAL

Your SPECIAL stats (Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, Luck) determine available perks and influence dialogue options throughout the game.

### üìä SPECIAL Allocation Strategy
You start with **21 points** to distribute (1 in each stat + 21 additional). Key considerations:

- **High stats (6-10)**: Access to powerful perks and unique dialogue
- **Moderate stats (4-5)**: Balanced approach with decent perk access  
- **Low stats (1-3)**: Accept limitations to excel elsewhere

  <strong>Good news:</strong> You can later increase SPECIAL through level-up points, collectibles (Bobbleheads), and the "You're SPECIAL!" book in Shaun's room.<br>
  <strong>Strategy:</strong> Start with your core concept, optimize as you discover preferred playstyles.
