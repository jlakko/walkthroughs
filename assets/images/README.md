# Placeholder images for Minecraft walkthrough

These are placeholder files for the walkthrough images. In a real implementation, these would be actual screenshots:

- minecraft-new-world.png - Screenshot of creating a new Minecraft world
- minecraft-branch-mine.png - Diagram showing efficient branch mining pattern  
- minecraft-enchanting-room.png - Screenshot of optimal enchanting room setup
- minecraft-end-portal-room.png - Screenshot of End portal room in stronghold
- minecraft-end-island.png - Screenshot of the End island with obsidian pillars
- minecraft-dragon-defeated.png - Screenshot of Ender Dragon death animation

These images would enhance the walkthrough with visual guides and examples.
For now, they serve as placeholders to demonstrate the image integration.
