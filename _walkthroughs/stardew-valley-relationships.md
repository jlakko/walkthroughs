## Understanding Friendship Mechanics

### Heart System Explained

Everyone starts at 0 hearts. Maximum is 10 hearts (12 for spouse).

**Heart Levels:**
- **1-2 Hearts:** Acquaintance (they acknowledge you exist)
- **3-4 Hearts:** Friend (starting to like you)
- **5-6 Hearts:** Good Friend (they trust you)
- **7-8 Hearts:** Close Friend (special events unlock)
- **9-10 Hearts:** Best Friend/Romance (marriage track for singles)

**How to gain hearts:**
- **Daily conversation:** +20 points (250 points = 1 heart)
- **Loved gift:** +80 points (birthday: +640!)
- **Liked gift:** +45 points (birthday: +360)
- **Festival participation:** Varies by event
- **Quest completion:** +150 points

**How to lose hearts:**
- **Hated gift:** -40 points (birthday: -320!)
- **Disliked gift:** -20 points
- **Digging in trash while they watch:** -25 points
- **Natural decay:** -2 points/day (stops at 10 hearts for spouse)

<div class="tip-box success">
  <div class="tip-title">üíù Birthday Pro Strategy</div>
  <strong>Mark your calendar!</strong> Giving a loved gift on someone's birthday gives 8x friendship points - that's +640 points (2.5 hearts worth!) in one gift. This is THE most efficient friendship method.
</div>

### Gift Preferences: Universal Guide

**Universal Loves (almost everyone loves these):**
- **Golden Pumpkin** (Spirit's Eve reward)
- **Magic Rock Candy** (rare)
- **Pearl** (very rare)
- **Prismatic Shard** (give to Gunther instead!)
- **Rabbit's Foot** (from rabbits)

**Universal Likes (safe bets):**
- **All gems** except Diamond (higher value = better)
- **Most flowers** (tulips, daffodils, etc.)
- **Most vegetables** (not all though!)
- **Maple Syrup, Honey** (artisan goods)

**Universal Dislikes:**
- **Wild Seeds** (cheap garbage in their eyes)
- **Clay, Stone, Wood** (construction materials)
- **Sap, Fiber** (trash-tier items)

**Universal Hates:**
- **Trash** (obviously)
- **Void Mayonnaise** (creepy)
- **Monster Loot** (slime, bug meat, bat wings)

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Exception Alert</div>
  Some villagers break the universal rules! For example, Haley HATES most "universal likes" like sunflowers (ironically). Always check specific preferences for your target villagers.

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Marriage Reality Check</div>
  <strong>Spouses aren't super useful mechanically.</strong> They're nice to have, but don't expect major farm help. Marriage is for story/roleplay, not optimization. Choose based on heart events and personality!
</div>

## Friendship Grinding Strategy

3. Complete quests from bulletin board (+150 points)
4. Attend all festivals (varies by event)

### Mid Game (Fall Year 1 - Year 2)

**Efficient gifting:**
- Check calendar for upcoming birthdays

- Don't stress about perfection

**Heart Event Unlocks:**
- 2 hearts: First personal event

<div class="tip-box">

</div>

## Common Relationship Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Ignoring Birthdays**
Missing birthdays is leaving 8x multipliers on the table. Always check the calendar!

**Mistake #2: Giving Universal Gifts to Everyone**
Some villagers hate "universal loves." Check before gifting your precious items.

**Mistake #3: Not Talking Daily**
Free +20 friendship points just for saying hi! Talk to everyone you see.

**Mistake #4: Giving Hated Gifts**
-40 points is brutal. If you're not sure, check preferences first. DON'T guess.

**Mistake #5: Rushing Marriage**
Heart events tell important stories. Don't skip them by rushing to 10 hearts and proposing immediately.

**Mistake #6: Trash Diving in Public**
Digging through trash while villagers watch reduces friendship. Do it at night or when alone!

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Gift Timing</div>
  You can only give TWO gifts per week per villager (resets Monday). Plan accordingly - give loved items, not liked items, to maximize efficiency!
