## What Counts as "Completion"?

Unlike games with a single ending, Fallout 4 offers multiple completion paths:

### üéå Primary Completion
Choose one of four faction endings:
- **Minutemen**: Rebuild the Commonwealth with civilian militia
- **Railroad**: Liberate synths and fight Institute oppression  
- **Brotherhood of Steel**: Bring order through military might
- **Institute**: Advance science from underground sanctuary

### üåü Extended Completion
- Max out all settlements and establish trade networks
- Complete all side quests and miscellaneous objectives
- Find all collectibles (Bobbleheads, Magazines, etc.)
- Unlock all base game achievements

### üéÆ Personal Goals
- Master settlement building and create showcase communities
- Experiment with different character builds and playstyles
- Complete challenge runs (Survival mode, specific faction loyalty)

## Getting Started

This guide assumes you're playing the **base game only**. DLC content (Far Harbor, Nuka-World) is covered in optional stub sections marked for future expansion.

**Before You Begin:**
1. **Choose your commitment level**: Quick story completion (~30 hours) vs. full completion (~80+ hours)
2. **Pick a faction interest**: This helps with character creation and early choices
3. **Decide on difficulty**: Normal for story focus, Survival for immersive challenge
4. **Consider spoiler tolerance**: All major plot points are clearly marked and hideable
