## Adding New Walkthroughs

This site uses Jekyll collections for walkthrough content. To add a new game walkthrough:

### 1. Directory Structure
Create the following structure (using Fallout 4 as example):

```
/fallout4/
  index.md                    # Main walkthrough landing page
/_walkthroughs/
  game-chapter-1.md          # Individual chapter files
  game-chapter-2.md
  ...
```

### 2. Chapter File Format
Each chapter uses this front matter template:

```yaml
---
title: "Chapter Title"
description: "Brief chapter description for SEO and navigation"
walkthrough: "game-name"           # Collection identifier
walkthrough_title: "Game Guide"   # Display name for navigation
chapter_order: 1                  # Numeric order for sorting
estimated_time: "30 minutes"      # Reading time estimate
breadcrumbs:                      # Navigation breadcrumbs
  - title: "Home"
    url: "/"
  - title: "Game Guide"
    url: "/game/"
  - title: "Chapter Title"
tips:                             # Quick tips for sidebar
  - "Helpful tip 1"
  - "Helpful tip 2"
tags: [game-name, category, etc]  # SEO tags
---
```

### 3. Spoiler System Usage
For games with story elements, use the spoiler component:

```html
<div class="spoiler-box warning">
  <div class="spoiler-header">
    <div class="spoiler-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Spoiler Warning</div>
    <div class="spoiler-toggle">‚ñº</div>
  </div>
  <div class="spoiler-content">
    <p>Hidden content that reveals plot points...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Navigation Integration
Update these files to include new walkthroughs:

- `_layouts/default.html`: Add navigation link
- `index.md`: Add walkthrough card to homepage
- Update stats if desired

### 5. Content Guidelines
Follow the established patterns:
- **Mobile-first**: Short paragraphs, clear headings
- **Gaming tone**: Conversational, knowledgeable, slightly humorous
- **Practical focus**: Clear objectives and actionable advice
- **Progress tracking**: Logical chapter progression with checkpoints
- **Accessibility**: Proper heading hierarchy and alt text
