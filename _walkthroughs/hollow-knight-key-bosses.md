Boss fights in Hollow Knight are some of the most memorable and challenging encounters in gaming. Each boss teaches you something new about combat, movement, or the game's systems. This chapter covers essential strategies for the major bosses you'll encounter.

## Boss Fight Philosophy

### Understanding Hollow Knight Combat
Unlike many action games, Hollow Knight rewards:
- **Pattern recognition** over reaction speed
- **Positioning** over aggressive damage dealing
- **Patience** over rushing to finish fights
- **Adaptation** over rigid strategies

### Universal Boss Strategies
1. **Learn before attacking**: Spend the first attempt just observing patterns
2. **Find safe spots**: Every boss has positions where you can't be hit
3. **Heal strategically**: Most bosses have predictable healing windows
4. **Manage Soul**: Balance offensive spells with healing needs

  Each boss builds on skills from previous fights. If you're struggling, make sure you've mastered earlier bosses and have appropriate upgrades.

## Early Game Bosses

### False Knight
**Location:** Forgotten Crossroads
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Beginner)
**When to fight:** Early in game, after acquiring basic movement

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Ground Slam**: Telegraphed overhead attack that creates shockwaves
- **Charge Attack**: Runs across the arena with armor extended
- **Falling Debris**: Chunks fall from ceiling during certain attacks

**Strategy:**
1. **Stay mobile**: Keep moving to avoid ground slams
2. **Attack the body**: When armor falls off, hit the small creature inside
3. **Use the walls**: Climb walls to avoid ground-based attacks
4. **Heal during staggers**: When the creature is exposed, you have time to heal

**Recommended charms:** Gathering Swarm (collect Geo), Fury of the Fallen (extra damage when low on health)

**Important Note:** After defeating False Knight, a chest beyond the arena contains the City Crest, which is useful for progression and opening access to the City of Tears later.

  <div class="tip-title">üí° False Knight Tips</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The real boss is the small creature, not the armor</li>
    <li>Wall climbing is your best defense against ground attacks</li>
    <li>Don't get greedy - wait for clear openings</li>
    <li>Practice pogo jumping on the creature when it's exposed</li>
    <li>Don't forget the City Crest chest after the fight!</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Hornet (Greenpath)
**Location:** Greenpath
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)
**When to fight:** To obtain the dash ability (Mothwing Cloak)
**Reward:** Mothwing Cloak (basic dash - provides horizontal mobility, no invulnerability frames)

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Needle Lunge**: Quick horizontal dash attack with needle extended
- **Aerial Thread Lunge**: Leaps into the air and dives toward your position
- **Hop and Throw**: Small hop followed by needle throw projectile
- **Defensive Reposition**: Quick movements to create distance

**Strategy:**
1. **Stay mobile**: Keep moving to avoid her lunge attacks
2. **Punish recovery**: Attack after she misses her dash or throw
3. **Aerial positioning**: Jump to avoid ground-level lunges
4. **Watch for patterns**: She telegraphs her attacks with distinct animations

**Key lessons:** This fight teaches movement timing and aerial combat positioning. Master this fight as it's required for the essential dash ability.

### Massive Moss Charger
**Location:** Greenpath
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (Easy-Intermediate)
**When to fight:** Optional, but good practice

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Charge attacks**: Runs back and forth across the arena
- **Spore clouds**: Releases toxic spores when damaged
- **Wall bouncing**: Bounces off walls unpredictably

**Strategy:**
1. **Use pogo jumping**: Bounce on its back to avoid charges
2. **Stay above spore clouds**: Airborne positioning is key
3. **Time your attacks**: Hit when it's stunned after wall impacts

## Mid Game Bosses

### Mantis Lords
**Location:** Mantis Village (Fungal Wastes)
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)
**When to fight:** After acquiring wall jump ability

**Phase 1 - Single Mantis:**
- **Boomerang throw**: Projectile that returns
- **Dash attack**: Quick horizontal movement
- **Wall jump attacks**: Attacks from wall positions

**Phase 2 - Two Mantis Lords:**
- **Coordinated attacks**: Both lords attack simultaneously
- **Cross patterns**: Attacks that require precise positioning
- **Wall-to-wall coordination**: Complex movement patterns

**Strategy:**
1. **Master Phase 1**: Don't attempt Phase 2 until Phase 1 is comfortable
2. **Use the center**: Stay in the middle to see both lords in Phase 2
3. **Dash timing is crucial**: Their attacks have precise timing windows
4. **Wall jump defensively**: Use walls to escape when overwhelmed

<div class="tip-box warning">
  <div class="tip-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Mantis Lords Difficulty</div>
  This is often the first real skill check in Hollow Knight. If you're struggling, consider returning with more health upgrades or better charms. The fight is optional but highly recommended for skill development.
</div>

### Soul Master
**Location:** Soul Sanctum (City of Tears)
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (Hard)
**When to fight:** Mid-game progression, story required

**Phase 1:**
- **Teleport attacks**: Appears at different locations
- **Orb projectiles**: Shoots multiple Soul orbs
- **Slam attacks**: Teleports above and slams down
- **Healing**: Attempts to heal when at low health

**Phase 2 (Fake-out):**
- **Resurrection**: Returns after apparent death
- **Enhanced speed**: Faster versions of Phase 1 attacks
- **Desperation attacks**: More aggressive pattern

**Strategy:**
1. **Learn teleport patterns**: He has preferred positions
2. **Interrupt healing**: Attack aggressively when he tries to heal
3. **Use spells**: Your own magic is very effective
4. **Stay patient in Phase 2**: Don't panic when he returns

**Recommended charms:** Shaman Stone (spell power), Quick Focus (faster healing)

### Brooding Mawlek
**Location:** Forgotten Crossroads
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (Intermediate)
**When to fight:** Optional early encounter (accessible early but challenging); infected variant appears later in the game

**Attack Patterns:**
- **Spit attacks**: Acid projectiles in arcs
- **Charge attacks**: Rushes across arena
- **Jump slams**: Vertical attacks from above

**Strategy:**
1. **Use platforms**: Stay on elevated positions when possible
2. **Dodge spits**: Learn the arc patterns to find safe spots
3. **Punish landings**: Attack after jump slams for guaranteed hits

**Note:** This boss can be fought relatively early but is tougher than False Knight. The area becomes infected later in the game, but this doesn't significantly change the fight mechanics.

## Late Game Bosses

### Hornet Sentinel (Kingdom's Edge)
**Location:** Kingdom's Edge
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (Hard)
**When to fight:** Late game progression, required for accessing the Abyss and obtaining Shade Cloak
**Reward:** King's Brand (grants access to the Abyss, where Shade Cloak is obtained)

**New attacks from first fight:**
- **Silk Shot**: Ranged projectile that pins you if it hits (not in first fight)
- **Thread Trap**: Creates silk traps on the ground
- **Spike trap**: Creates large spike areas
- **Thread barriers**: Blocks parts of the arena
- **Enhanced speed**: All attacks are faster than first encounter
- **Combo attacks**: Chains multiple attacks together

**Strategy:**
1. **Mobility is key**: Use all your movement abilities (you should have most by now)
2. **Learn spike patterns**: Spikes have safe zones
3. **Break barriers quickly**: Don't let thread limit your movement
4. **Heal during spikes**: Spike attacks create healing windows
5. **Stay patient**: This fight is significantly harder than the first Hornet encounter

**Important:** The King's Brand reward is essential for late-game progression, as it allows you to enter the Abyss and obtain the Shade Cloak (shadow dash upgrade with phasing and invulnerability).

### The Hollow Knight (Final Boss)
**Location:** Temple of the Black Egg
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very Hard)
**When to fight:** After defeating all three Dreamers

<div class="spoiler-box warning">
  <div class="spoiler-header">
    <div class="spoiler-title">‚ö†Ô∏è Ending Spoilers</div>
    <div class="spoiler-toggle">‚ñº</div>

  <div class="spoiler-content">
    <p><strong>Multiple endings:</strong> This fight has different outcomes based on your progress. Having the Void Heart charm unlocks additional phases and the true ending.</p>
  </div>
</div>

**Phase 1 - Basic Patterns:**
- **Nail attacks**: Three-hit combo with wide range
- **Focus blast**: Charges up and releases large projectile
- **Lunge attacks**: Quick forward movement
- **Parry stance**: Defensive position that can counter your attacks

**Phase 2 - Infection Influence:**
- **Self-damage**: Boss starts hurting itself
- **Blob attacks**: Infection creates additional threats
- **Erratic patterns**: Less predictable movement
- **Stagger opportunities**: More openings for damage

**Strategy:**
1. **Learn the nail combo**: His three-hit pattern has specific timing
2. **Punish focus charges**: Long wind-up gives you time to position and attack
3. **Stay mobile**: His range is extensive, so keep moving
4. **Be patient in Phase 2**: Don't get overwhelmed by the infection elements

- **Useful charms equipped** (see recommendations below)

### Recommended Charm Builds

- **Quick Slash**: Faster attack speed

**Spell Build:**

### Universal Boss Tips

**Before the Fight:**
- **Save at the nearest bench**: Minimize runback distance

**During the Fight:**
- **First attempt is for learning**: Focus on observing patterns
