<div class="tip-box">
  <div class="tip-title">üîÑ Faction Divergence Point</div>
  <strong>Critical moment:</strong> After "The Molecular Level", you choose which faction helps build the teleporter. This begins your path toward faction-specific endings.<br>
  <strong>Safe exploration:</strong> You can complete early quests for ALL factions before this point without consequences.
</div>

### üéØ Teleporter Construction Choice

This decision affects your entry into the Institute but doesn't lock out other factions yet:

**Railroad Construction Path:**
- Provides stealth infiltration options
- Ballistic Weave armor modification access
- Railroad agents support Institute infiltration

**Brotherhood Construction Path:**
- Military support and advanced equipment
- Power armor and energy weapon access
- Aggressive Institute approach preparation

**Minutemen Construction Path:**
- Settlement-based support network
- Artillery support capabilities
- Democratic approach to Institute problem

**Independent Construction Path:**
- Solo infiltration with minimal faction commitment
- Preserve maximum faction flexibility
- Requires higher Intelligence or finding Scientists
